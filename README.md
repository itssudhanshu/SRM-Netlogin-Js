# JS-Scraping

I built an Automated Login API which automatically login me to the SRM Academia Website and scraps the user data like Timetable, Attendance table etc and take a screenshots and save it to your local drive.

It only requires to set the SRM-Academia username and password for one time in the script and it works you individually.
The language that I used :
- NodeJs (puppeteer)
